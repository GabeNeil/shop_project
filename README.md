Welcome to your new job at Gabetars, Scotland's newest guitar retailer!

You will be using our proprietory inventory app developed by our IT division Gabeabytes. This app allows you to view, add to and edit our current stock and manufacturers. 

The home page gives you general information about the app, the guitar page gives you a list of all our stock and the manufacturers page gives a list of our current manufactuer stockists. 

You can add to both manufacturers and guitars on their respective pages, and and edit or delete each entry individually. 

Best of luck in your new role and please keep drinking at work to a 5 unit maximum. Also don't let any customers play Stairway.
